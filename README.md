# Wi-Fi-Controlled-Car
In this project i have developed a car which is controlled by the wi-fi network in Blynk android application. The wi-fi robot car can be easily moved from one place to another place by using the command in Blynk application. I can make the car do the various task using wi-fi network technology.

The Wi-Fi Car which i have built is small in size so it can be used for spying purpose. With few additions and modifications, this car can be used in army for detecting and disposing hidden land mines. It can be used for surveillance. Wireless camera can be added to the car to incorporate other security features.
